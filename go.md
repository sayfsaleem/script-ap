Set Emails on Default Layout: Ensure that the default layout for emails is established. This means configuring the email settings to display in a standardized format that is suitable for processing.

Set Emails to Go to Saved: Direct the system to save emails rather than deleting them after they've been processed. This allows for further review or processing at a later time if necessary.

Loop for Changing Pages: Implement a loop mechanism similar to the one used for navigating through different pages. This loop should iterate through each page of data.

Data Extraction Within the Loop: Inside the loop, extract relevant data from each page. This includes information such as company name, email, phone number, website, and number of employees.

Data Collection and Storage: As the loop progresses through each page, collect and store the extracted data.

CSV Generation: Once all pages have been processed, automatically generate a CSV file containing the collected data. Ensure that the CSV file is formatted neatly and cleanly for easy analysis and further use.
